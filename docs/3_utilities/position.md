title: Position

## Introduction

Position utility classes.

```html!
<div class="position-static">...</div>
<div class="position-relative">...</div>
<div class="position-absolute">...</div>
<div class="position-fixed">...</div>
<div class="position-sticky">...</div>
```

[IE10 and IE11 don't support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-sticky) `.sticky-top` (position: sticky). They will interpret it as `position: relative`.

```html!
<div class="fixed-top">...</div>
<div class="fixed-bottom">...</div>
<div class="sticky-top">...</div>
```

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
